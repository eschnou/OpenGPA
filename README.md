**OpenGPA** is an Open-source General Purpose Agent. A self-hosted solution supporting smart AI agent developments
with chain of thought, tool use and memory access through RAG.

- Agentic system with multi-step-reasoning, chain-of-thought, ReAct, tool use etc
- Support for [all major LLMs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatmodel.html) such as LLama, Mistral, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.
- Off-line first. You can run on your own box with a local LLM. Data won't leave the server. All the power of GPT without the data privacy nightmare.
- Extensible framework allows to plug your own actions, such as calling into internal services and APIs
- Simple UI exposing insight on the GPA internal reasoning and actions
- Built-in RAG to search internal document stores
- Free and open source, deploy anywhere, customize to your needs

## :pencil2: Design principles

OpenGPA is much more than a UI on top of a LLM. It implements an agentic workflow, where a LLM is used as the 
*brain* of an agent to reason through multiple steps of planning, reasoning, and tool use.  In particular, OpenGpa 
is using the [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) approach to verbally reason on the next step, decide on the action to execute, 
and observe the outcome.

```
{
  "reasoning": "The user wants to know the current weather in Liege, Belgium. 
                The best action to get this information is to perform a web search with 
                the query 'current weather in Liege, Belgium'. The result of this action 
                will then be used to respond to the user's request. 
                This is not the final action as we have to get the results from the web 
                search first."
  "action": {
    "name": "webSearch",
    "arguments": {
      "query": "current weather in Liege, Belgium"
    }
  },
  "is_final": false
}
```

Action selection is based on a catalog of action that can easily be extended through code. You could add an action
to tap into an internal service to fetch some data, or a workflow engine to trigger a next step, etc.

## üõ†Ô∏èÔ∏è Key Features

The current version already packs a few interesting pieces:
- Works with all LLM supported by [spring-ai](https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai), including running **LLama** locally
- Multi-step task processing with **chain-of-thought** approach
- Action model with easy to extend **actions** for use by the agent
- Upload of **artifacts** to process by the agent
- Download of **artifacts** generated by the agent
- Import documents in knowledge base to support **Retrieval Augmented Generation** search

## üöß Roadmap

Improve the Agentic capabilities:
- **Memory** enabling the agent to remember key facts and use them later
- **code generation** and **execution** within the agent (using Groovy scripts?)
- **remote API invocation** to tap into existing enterprise APIs
- **web interactions** allowing the agent to navigate pages submit forms
- **scheduled** jobs for automating workflow
- **triggers** to create complete end-to-end workflows

Make OpenGPA enterprise ready:
- Persistence of tasks/steps
- Proper file storage and management
- User management and access control
- Secure API access through API gateway
- Auditing of task processing costs (token usage)
- Instrumentation and observability

## üöÄ Getting started

In case of trouble, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3XPsmCRNE2) for help!

### Quickstart (no need to clone this repo)

The `docker-compose.quickstart.yml` makes it easy to launch the latest stable version with 
a postgresql database (with pg_vector extension), the opengpa backend and the frontend, on the same
host.

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eschnou/opengpa-server/main/docker-compose.quickstart.yml
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here" > .env
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml up -d
```

### Build and run with Docker

The simplest way to build and launch OpenGPA is using the provided Docker compose file:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*** 
docker compose up --build
```

This will build the opengpa image from source with all required dependencies (in particular the Playwright
dependencies for web browsing) and launch the service on port 3000. Opening http://localhost:3000 will lead you
to the OpenAPI documentation.

### Build and run the server

If you are on a Mac, the following should be enough to get you started and running this
locally.  

> [!WARNING]
> Building requires __Java 21__. If you are on a Mac, you can easily install it
> with `brew install openjdk@21`

By default, opengpa is using OpenAI gpt-4o as its LLM. Check the `application.properties` file 
for configuration options and the spring-ai documentation to configure support for other LLMs.


```bash
mvn clean package -Pproduction
docker compose up -d db
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-*** java -jar opengpa-server/target/opengpa-server-0.2.0.jar
```

The `docker compose up -d db` lauches the database part from the docker compose as opengpa requires
a postgres database with pg_vector for the RAG feature. 

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The User Interface is available in the [OpenGPA Frontend repository](https://github.com/eschnou/opengpa-frontend) and
can be launched with docker.

```
git clone https://github.com/eschnou/opengpa-frontend
cd opengpa-frontend
docker build -t opengpa-frontend:latest .
docker run -p 8000:8000 opengpa-frontend
```

### üêõ Debugging

For debugging purposes you can log all interactions and prompts using the following config:
```
opengpa.server.log-prompt=true
opengpa.server.log-folder=/tmp/opengpa/logs
```
