# Hacker news daily brief

Fetch the top three news (as ranked by points) on Hacker News front page (https://news.ycombinator.com/front). Read
their content. If a page can't be fetched, move to the next one. 

Summarise each news article in the style of a tech radio show host, use spoken language, explain key facts in simple terms 
and with a bit of humour. 

Create a final script for a radio show about technology called 'Hacker News Daily', with an introduction mentioning the 
current date, then the three stories fluently linked from one to the other, and finally an outro thanking the listener
and inviting them to join again tomorrow.
